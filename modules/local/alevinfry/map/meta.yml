            Alevin is a tool — integrated with the salmon software — that introduces a family of algorithms 
            for quantification and analysis of 3’ tagged-end single-cell sequencing data. 
            Currently alevin supports the following two major droplet based single-cell protocols:
              Drop-seq

          Either:
          1) A three-column (headerless) tab-separated file where the first column contains a target name,
            the second column contains the corresponding gene feature to which this target belongs and 
            the third column contains either S or U, with S denoting the corresponding feature should be 
            attributed to the spliced status of its parent gene and U denoting that it should be attributed 
            to the unspliced status of its parent gene.
          2) A two-column (headerless) tab-separated file where the first column contains a transcript name 
            and the second column contains the corresponding gene name for this transcript.
